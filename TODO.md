# TODO List
* Support Python3
* Speed up using Pytorch's native dimension format
* Use Pytorch to implement different DNNs for variant calling e.g. LSTM
* Try different hyperparameters such as Alpha dropout probabilities.
* Try parallelising over a larger number of similar GPUs for a decrease in epoch time
